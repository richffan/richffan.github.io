## 01 Two idle sentences

Before writing, it is useless to withdraw two sentences...

First of all, don't demonize the IPO, although the situation of "a project from entry to departure" is true, the essential reasons that lead to departure, I personally think there are three reasons...

### 1. Make the audit a statistic

At least before the project manager, especially when you first join, it's easy to turn an audit into a statistic... Of course, this kind of embarrassment is actually quite helpless for children, even on the day of resignation, did not come out of the shadow of the humanoid copier and the walking scanner, and the repeated text and number entry, to be honest, it was really quite persuasive...

### 2. Tune and tune

From the first day of entering the market to the last minute of the report report, all kinds of tuning and adjustment also belong to a kind of soul torture for auditors, the final version, kill the version, and then change the I am a dog version... Whether it is a draft, adjustment entry, report or document, in the process of homework, I feel that there is always only the latest version, and the wood has the final version, and the moment when the change is notified can only be laughed away...

### 3. Confusion

The project squatted for several months, the dogs in the factory were all mixed, and they couldn't sleep when they went home... The circle of friends gradually disappeared... Sleep later than a dog, wake up earlier than a chicken, earn half of your salary to the landlord, half to the hospital... Every auditor may from time to time have the illusion of "who I am, where I am, what am I doing":

In response to the above three points, to be honest, there is no good solution, especially in the first few years of employment, just like a primary apprentice in a restaurant, washing vegetables and washing his hands peeled, finally picking up a knife, and finding that he can only do the work of chopping vegetables... There really are no shortcuts from entry to career. Whether it is an IPO or an annual review, the firm actually provides a platform, and it is entirely up to you how to perform on this platform, how long you want to act, whether you are willing to act as a background, or stand in the spotlight and become the focus of attention.

Secondly, IPO is not the only way to progress, although IPO in the operation will indeed be more refined than the general project, but the actual test is the manager or site leader for the overall risk grasp of the project, children are mostly executors, at best can understand the operation mode of their own responsibility, this is not pejorative at best, but standing on the "point" of the draft, it is difficult to perceive the connection of the "surface" of the report, and the "three-dimensional structure" of leaving the business is even more out of reach, so, Early exposure to IPOs is not necessarily a good thing for newcomers, and rather than specializing in a certain "point", faster exposure to "faces" may be more beneficial for future career development, whether or not to continue to work in auditing.

Finally, IPO and other audit projects are not the same system, are risk identification and risk response operation mode, the difference is that IPO enterprises whether in the effectiveness of internal control or in the face of the major interests of "making quick money", there are potential major misstatement risks and even fraud risks (of course, it does not mean that listed companies have no risks), and it is precisely because of this characteristic that the IPO project site can often be described as "tragic"...

Nagging this point is not good to persuade a large number of people, but still want to say, in fact, no matter what kind of project to do, what kind of people to follow, the key is to think clearly, to have expectations, to have a plan, otherwise you may just step into the door, the mentality will collapse...

## 02 Body...

### 1. The key points of the review of monetary funds

According to Yi Dong's statistics (thanks to Gua Ge's strong support), monetary funds have a 27.56% probability of being inquired in IPO projects, which ranks 10th among all asset-liability related accounts, which is not high, but it is definitely not low... And compared to other balance sheet accounts, monetary funds have a very disgusting point... It is that the scope involved is very wide, and the workload when answering inquiries is unimaginable... Here's a look at the high-frequency vocabulary involved in monetary funds in the inquiry

Of course, there is another way that 80 assets are bought / prepaid at 100, and the more part is used to wash profits, why does it have to be fixed assets? Because Guiah... For example, 100 million engineering infrastructure stuffed 20 million into it, and buying 1 million parts a year, each part is 20 yuan more, everyone knows that the method is better fraud...

### 2. Wealth management products/interest income/investment income

This brother three tied a piece and said... Because the three are bound when the basic inquiry is made.

The vast majority of IPO companies will introduce strategic investors during the reporting period, and the actual capital contribution of strategic investors will bring a large amount of liquidity to the company, and there will be a large surplus in operating capital in a short period of time, which makes many companies purchase wealth management products during the reporting period, and the more typical inquiry methods are: (1) the deposit and management of the issuer's monetary funds, the matching of monetary funds with interest income, wealth management products, etc. with investment income, and whether there are restrictions on rights such as pledges of bank deposits held; (2) the issuer's purchase of wealth management products or other debt investments during the reporting period, including but not limited to the name of the specific product, the issuer of the product and the financial institutions involved, the investment target and the underlying assets, the term, the rate of return, the redemption or maturity time, the matching with the cash received for the recovery of the investment and the cash paid for the investment, whether the necessary investment decision-making procedures have been performed, and whether there is a risk of default; (3) The issuer's fund management measures, whether there are situations in which funds flow directly or indirectly to the actual controller, controlling shareholders, customers, suppliers or related parties of the issuer, whether there is a situation of extracorporeal capital circulation or covertly providing guarantees or conveying benefits to related parties.

Various forms of wealth management products are also one of the key areas of regulatory attention, especially trusts, venture capital and other projects that may have extracorporeal circulation of funds, fraud cases can be seen in the Fenghua Hi-Tech case, which will not be repeated here.

 3. Large certificates of deposit/restricted funds

Large-amount certificates of deposit are also projects with high incidence of fraud in recent years, and the case can participate in the Fukong interactive case, and the essence of fraud is to guarantee shareholders' external loans through the pledge of large-amount certificates of deposit. In addition to large certificates of deposit, all kinds of restricted funds, such as bill margins, have also been favored by regulators because of the particularity of their nature...

 4. Cash transaction / capital flow verification

Why put these two separately, because these two may be pulled out separately for questioning... why？ "Guidelines for the Application of Regulatory Rules – Issuance No. 5"Learn more... Issuance No. 5 provides separate reminders on cash transactions and capital flow verification, as follows:

 5-10 Cash transactions
If there are cash transactions or large amounts of cash to pay salaries, reimburse expenses, or advance various types of payments during the reporting period, the sponsor and the reporting accountant should generally pay attention to and verify the following aspects:

1. The necessity and reasonableness of cash transactions or large cash payments, whether they are in line with the issuer's business conditions or industry practices, and whether the proportion of cash transactions and their changes are within a reasonable range.

2. Whether the customer or supplier of the cash transaction involves a related party of the issuer.

3. The principles and basis of relevant revenue recognition and cost accounting, whether it involves extracorporeal circulation or fictitious business.

4. Whether the cash management system matches the business model and internal management system, and whether the internal control system related to cash transactions and cash payment is complete, reasonable and effective.

5. Whether the occurrence of cash transaction flow and related business occurrence are true and consistent, and whether there is abnormal distribution.

6. Whether the actual controller and related parties such as directors, supervisors and executives of the issuer and the target of large cash payments have financial transactions with customers or suppliers and their affiliates.

7. Improvement measures taken by the issuer to reduce cash transactions and progress.

8. Where the proportion of cash transactions reaches the materiality level, whether the relevant risks are fully disclosed.

The sponsor institution and the reporting accountant shall explain in detail the verification methods, processes and evidence of the issuer's cash transactions and large-amount cash payments, and express clear opinions on the authenticity, reasonableness and necessity of the issuer's cash transactions and large-amount cash payments and the effectiveness of relevant internal controls.



 5-15 Verification of capital flow

 1. Applicable circumstances

The sponsor institution and the reporting accountant shall fully assess factors such as the issuer's operating environment, industry type, business process, standard operation level, level of major financial data and change trend, and determine the specific procedures and abnormal standards for the issuer's relevant capital flow verification, so as to reasonably ensure that the issuer's financial statements are free from the risk of material misstatement. Issuers and their controlling shareholders, actual controllers, directors, supervisors, executives and other relevant personnel shall, in accordance with the principle of good faith, provide complete bank account information to intermediaries, and cooperate with intermediaries in verifying capital flow. Intermediaries should exercise due diligence, use reliable means to obtain verification information, and exercise due diligence in determining the scope of verification and implementing verification procedures. Under the premise of complying with the relevant laws and regulations on bank account inquiry, the scope of capital flow verification may include the flow of funds in bank accounts opened or controlled by controlling shareholders, actual controllers, major affiliates of the issuer, directors, supervisors, executives, key positions, etc., as well as the flow of funds in bank accounts opened or controlled by affiliates and employees of the issuer who have abnormal transactions with the above-mentioned bank accounts.

　　 2. Verification requirements

In the verification of capital flow, the sponsor institution and the reporting accountant should combine the principle of materiality and support the needs of the verification conclusion, and focus on verifying the following matters that occurred during the reporting period: (1) whether there are major deficiencies in the internal control system related to the issuer's fund management; (2) whether there are any circumstances in which the bank account is not controlled by the issuer or not fully reflected in the issuer's financial accounting, and whether there are any inconsistencies with business needs, such as the number of bank accounts opened by the issuer; (3) whether there are major abnormalities in the issuer's large capital transactions. Whether it is incompatible with the company's business activities, asset purchases, foreign investment, etc.; (4) whether there are abnormally large capital transactions between the issuer and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, directors, supervisors, senior executives, personnel in key positions, etc.; (5) whether the issuer has large or frequent cash withdrawals, and whether there is no reasonable explanation; Whether there is no reasonable explanation for whether there are abnormally large amounts of funds entering and exiting the issuer's same account or between different accounts, or whether there is no reasonable explanation; (6) whether the issuer has purchased assets or services (such as trademarks, patented technology, consulting services, etc.) in large amounts without physical form and, if so, whether there are doubts about the commercial reasonableness of the relevant transactions; (7) the actual controller of the issuer has a large amount of funds in the personal account without reasonable explanation, or there are frequent situations of large cash deposits and withdrawals; (8) controlling shareholders, Whether the actual controller, directors, supervisors, senior executives and personnel in key positions have received large amounts of cash dividends, remuneration or asset transfer funds from the issuer, or transferred the equity of the issuer to obtain large equity transfer funds, and there are major abnormalities in the flow or use of the main funds; (9) whether the controlling shareholders, actual controllers, directors, supervisors, senior executives and personnel in key positions have abnormally large capital transactions with the issuer's affiliates, customers and suppliers; (10) Whether there are circumstances where a related party collects payments from customers or pays suppliers on behalf of the issuer.

If the issuer has the following circumstances during the reporting period, the sponsor institution and the reporting accountant should consider whether it is necessary to expand the scope of capital flow verification: (1) there are major irregularities in the management of the issuer's reserve funds, external payments, etc.; (2) there are large abnormal changes in the issuer's gross profit margin, period expense ratio, net sales margin and other indicators in each period, or there are major inconsistencies with companies in the same industry; (3) the issuer's distribution model accounts for a relatively high or significantly higher proportion than that of companies in the same industry, and there is a large abnormality in the distribution gross profit margin; (4) (5) The issuer entrusts part of the production process to other parties for processing, and the entrusted processing costs change significantly, or the unit cost and gross profit margin are significantly different from those of the same industry; (5) the proportion of imports in the issuer's total procurement is relatively high or the proportion of exports in the total sales is relatively high, and the corresponding purchase unit price, sales unit price, overseas supplier or customer qualifications are relatively abnormal; (6) the issuer's major purchase and sales transactions, foreign investment or large receipts and payments have doubts about the commercial reasonableness; (7) directors, supervisors, executives, Major changes in the salary level of personnel in key positions; (8) Other abnormal circumstances.

The sponsor institution and the reporting accountant should also express a clear verification opinion on whether the issuer's internal control is sound and effective, whether there is a situation where the circulation of funds in vitro forms sales collection, and bears costs and expenses.

###  5. Internal Control

If it is the point above, it will basically turn to the internal control... Investment decision-making, capital budget management, wealth management product selection... Balabala... Of course, not only monetary funds, but also financial related issues will basically involve internal control when inquiring, why? In general, let's first introduce how the management itself controls the risk...

By the way, internal control really do not open your mouth to come, internal control system and specific control documents are the core content of on-site inspection, do not make something out of nothing, or it will really be inspected on the spot, and the probability will be hung up and beaten...



 2. Audit response of monetary funds
 1. Routine response

 Too lazy to write ...

 Everything always has a priority, good preparation can greatly reduce the pressure of work, the following is a simple list of some common inspection items, can be used as a list of information to communicate with the audited unit when entering or before entering the site:

 (1) List of bank settlement accounts that have been opened

 (2) Enterprise credit report

(3) Bank statements, balance reconciliations, lists of accounts cancelled and opened during the audit period

(4) Original certificate of deposit and account opening certificate; Copy of certificate of deposit (if pledged)

 (5) Agreements and approval documents for bankers' acceptances, letters of credit, etc

(6) The loan contract and its foregoing mortgage, pledge, guarantee and credit granting agreement

 (7) Cash inventory table (self-inventory)

Why is the only list of bank settlement accounts opened marked in red here, because in the 2019 CSRC's "Accounting Supervision Risk Reminder No. 9 - Occupation of Funds by Controlling Shareholders of Listed Companies and Their Audit" (hereinafter referred to as "Reminder No. 9"), it is particularly emphasized that "when implementing the letter procedure, certified public accountants should pay attention to the integrity of the bank accounts provided by listed companies, and if there are doubts about the integrity, they should personally go to the bank where the People's Bank of China or basic deposit account is opened to inquire and print the "List of Opened Bank Settlement Accounts". "Since the supervising dad is kind enough to prompt, isn't it a little too unreasonable not to keep up....

Of course, if it is found in the process that the issuer has cash transactions, large financial management and other above-mentioned key matters, the information needs to be further supplemented, and it will be written later when writing the special response (if I didn't write it, I forgot.. ）

 Routine responses mainly include:

(1) Account integrity check: the account opening list is checked with the account account, emm, there will really be enterprises that mix multiple accounts of a bank together for accounting... Therefore, do not default to the account information on the account must be compatible with the account opening list. In addition, temporary accounts such as margin and wealth management accounts are not displayed on the account opening list, in practice, there is no particularly targeted response to the audit of temporary accounts, in addition to the cross-checking of large funds, the main purpose of this is to check whether there are other unrecorded or unobtained accounts, such as the existence of accounts that have not been obtained during the flow of large amounts of funds (believe me, not a small probability event)...

(2) Supervision: mainly reflected in the monitoring of cash and deposit certificates (at the same time, you can easily get the bills together, if there are paper bills), of course, there is also a word to say here, that is, if you find abnormal situations such as white slips and IOUs during inventory, you must inform the person in charge of the site in time...

(3) Correspondence: Well, the procedure of the death series such as the business trip ... One more word to say here, too... That is, before the letter is issued, it must be implemented one by one on the letter project, including deposits, loans, wealth management, guarantees, bills and other letter information, in addition, most banks now use the letter center, so there is no problem in contacting in advance, or a letter tossed three or four times is not impossible. Common moths include: wrong loan/guarantee date, wrong interest rate, wrong account number, wrong bank name, oh, and very much more that the name of the enterprise or legal person information has changed, but the company has not gone to the bank to update.

Let's fool the routine response here... There's nothing new about the cliché...

 2. Fraud response

The words may be a little small... If you can use a computer to watch, it's best not to use a mobile phone... If you look at it on your phone, please click on the picture... Or you'll really be blind...

![](https://jsd.cdn.zzko.cn/gh/richffan/img@main/audit/IPO-Audit-Notes/IPO-Audit-Notes-1.0-Monetary-Funds_02.webp)

The above fraud response is based on the fraud risk response measures to do their own collation, for reference only, the writing is relatively simple, can only be regarded as throwing bricks and jade, the big guys spit lightly...

 3. Special considerations for IPO projects

This title is actually not appropriate, in fact, if there are conditions, high-risk projects are not limited to IPO projects, just to avoid being quality control or inquiring Q's body, or need to make some preparations in advance.

 (1) Large-value certificates of deposit

The first thing to make clear about a large certificate of deposit is very important: the original must be seen! Photocopies are definitely not an option. This is not limited to IPO projects, if the amount of the time deposit certificate is significant, it is even necessary to consider checking the original deposit certificate again before the audit report is issued, so as to avoid the red line problems such as the enterprise using the time deposit certificate for pledge and concealing related guarantees after evidence collection. Secondly, the conventional correspondence procedures and the inspection of rights and obligations cannot be relaxed, so as to avoid the major hidden danger of uncertain ownership of large-sum certificates of deposit.

Of course, one might say that fraud is well-designed and can be difficult to detect... There is nothing wrong with this, but it is not difficult to look at the original... It's not hard to take another look before the report... If you only look at the scan, who do you say is unlucky when something happens?

 Child: Signing accountant

 Signing Accountant: ...

  (2) Wealth management products

If there is a significant amount of financial management during the reporting period, don't think about it... Stroke by pen, such as the previous typical inquiry question, "specific product name, product issuer and financial institutions involved, investment targets and underlying assets, term, yield, redemption or maturity time", it is recommended to form a special draft according to these fields, if you wait for the inquiry to reproduce the whole, it will really scratch the wall... Especially if the issuer is also very keen to buy short-term money... Of course, the form of the form still tries to refer to the feedback responses of the past or conference projects.

In addition, due to the application of the new financial instruments standard, the presentation of wealth management products needs to recognize the reported items and corresponding accounting treatment according to the contractual cash flows of specific products, so... It is also necessary to make some knowledge in advance. Oh, there are theoretical judgment standards for "2-11 Classification of Purchased Bank Wealth Management Products" in "Case Analysis of Listed Companies Implementing Enterprise Accounting Standards 2020", which can be referred to (but it is difficult for thieves to understand).

图片 Really don't underestimate financial products, some may still be fake financial management, real hedging, so if the corresponding agreement you can't understand, or see words such as priority, inferior, forward settlement, capital pool, etc., please throw it to the on-site person in charge or signing manager as soon as possible...

 (3) Verification of capital flow
 One of the most disgusting verification procedures for IPO projects...

First of all, we must give priority to solving the problem of checking the account integrity of the sample, not only limited to the flow of legal persons/enterprises, but also the flow of directors, supervisors, and related parties mentioned in the previous capital flow verification. In order to facilitate verification, it is recommended to form a special account control table to check whether all the flows of the samples have been obtained during the reporting period. Why do this step first, because if the account is incomplete, such as 10 accounts with three rollovers, then the result of cross-checking is about equal to doing it for nothing...

Secondly, do not rely too much on tools, plug-ins, although computer tools now provide a lot of solutions, but the premise of using data processing tools is that the data can be processed... What does it mean? For example, the flow format of different banks, the header is strange, the current tool is not foreign enough to automatically identify the number of rows or columns where the key field is located, so before using the tool, it is necessary to give priority to data cleaning, the flow of different formats unified format, of course, which also includes the most CD to convert the text format into numbers... It's useless to say too much, do it yourself once and you will know how painful this procedure is...

Finally, as an accountant... Be sure to maintain professional sensitivity and professional suspicion, and inform the person in charge of the site (or run away with a bucket) in time if the following situations occur during the check convection flow process:

(1). In the case that the amount of two or more adjacent transactions is similar or the same, but the counterparties are different, such as collecting 1 million from the customer and immediately paying the supplier 1 million; (Transaction authenticity)

(2). There is a large amount of cash deposits, cash withdrawals, and the company's daily business activities do not involve a significant amount of cash receipts and expenditures; (Appropriation of funds)

(3) There is a large amount of money received and paid by the same counterparty (customer or supplier); (Withdrawing/withdrawing funds/potential affiliation to the correspondent)

(4). The counterparty of the significant amount turnover is inconsistent with the accounting unit; (Third-party collection and payment; Fraud forged payment)

## 03 epilogue

Well, I didn't write about internal controls ... Because this thing children see that it is really not much help, internal control itself requires a certain project experience, it is recommended that enterprises standardize internal control first of all to identify the obvious internal control defects of the enterprise, secondly, the suggestions need to be landed and implementable, or it may be counterproductive if they are not carried out according to the book.

 Reader: Actually, you're just too lazy to write...

 I:...

The difficulty of IPO is often reflected in the quality control and supervision of "unpreventable" inquiries, which caught the project team "unprepared", but I personally understand that in the early stage of due diligence and entry, combined with the company's own situation, it is possible to meet some key points that may be concerned, it is not recommended to follow the previous annual review or general audit project operation mode "go through the process", or need to make some targeted preparations in the planning stage and implementation stage, including full communication with the issuer in advance, otherwise wait for the follow-up inquiry jam. It is very likely that you will end up with a pot on your own back, and live a sad end of doing it yourself...

 Rory wrote a lot of it, I hope it will help everyone...
